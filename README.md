# Rock-Paper-Scissors
The Odin Project - Mini Assignment - Rock Paper Scissors

In this project, we were instructed to build a Javascript application. 
The application was to be a game, that ran in the browser, where a user could play Rock,Papper, Scissors against the computer. The project utalized Javascript knowledge, as well as command line and git. 
Additionally, I used JS Bin (http://jsbin.com/) to run and test my project.
